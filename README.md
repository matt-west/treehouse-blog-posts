# Treehouse Blog Post

This repo contains the raw markdown files for the posts I write for Treehouse.

Sometimes changes are made to the posts after they are added to the Treehouse CMS and therefore the posts here may differ slightly from their published counterparts.

Demos can be found [here](https://github.com/matt-west/demos.matt-west.com).
